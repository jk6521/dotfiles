### Information
Here are some details of what I used.

| Tool | Used |
| ---- | ---- |
| OS | [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) |
| WM | [Hyprland](hyprland.org/) |
| Terminal | [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) |
| Shell | [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) |
| Editor | [NvChad](nvchad.com/)/[Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |
| Application Launcher | [Wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) |
| Bar | [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) |
| Wallpaper | [Hyprpaper](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper) |


### Why I chose hyprland?
I've been using gnome in kali linux for years, but with my potato
laptop I couldn't achieve great productivity and speed. I tried arch linux quite few times but faced problems each time, with confidence I tried this time and I came successful after trying bspwm and i3.
