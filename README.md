### Why I chose hyprland?
I've been using gnome in kali linux for years, but with my potato
laptop I couldn't achieve great productivity and speed. I tried arch linux quite few times but faced problems each time, with confidence I tried this time and I came successful after trying bspwm and i3.

- Hyprland is really great and easy to customize compared to other tiling window managers like bspwm,I found it little hard for a newbie like me to setup dual monitor but in hyprland it just gets detected automatically and assigns workspace according to that.

- The great thing which comes useful in auto reload of configuration without any hustle and inbuilt compositor
